# Virtual Voice Assistant using ElevenLabs

## Intro
This is my small pet project where I'm building my own virtual voice assistant. My long term goal is to make it a complete virtual avatar that would be able to communicate and behave human-like.

### Setup
You can download the necessary libs using the script below:

    pip install elevenlabs elevenlabs[pyaudio] python-dotenv

Note that for code to run you will also need to have an account on ElevenLab and provide your API key and Agent ID.

For this, follow the guide on <a href="https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/14599447207697-How-do-I-authorize-myself-using-an-API-key">how to authorize yourself using an API key.</a>
